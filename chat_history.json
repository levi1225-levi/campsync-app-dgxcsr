[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "CampSync is a secure, offline-capable digital platform designed to manage and streamline operations for a single summer camp. It centralizes staff workflows, camper management, incident reporting, NFC wristband usage, and parent engagement into one cohesive system built for real-world camp environments.\r\n\r\nCampSync is designed for speed, safety, and reliability in settings where staff are mobile, connectivity may be unreliable, and accurate camper information is critical. The platform prioritizes operational efficiency, privacy, and ease of use for both staff and parents.\r\n\r\nCore Goals\r\n\r\n\u2022 Replace paper-based and fragmented camp processes\r\n\u2022 Enable fast camper identification and status tracking\r\n\u2022 Ensure medical and emergency data is always accessible to authorized staff\r\n\u2022 Support camps even when internet connectivity is poor or unavailable\r\n\u2022 Maintain strict privacy and security standards\r\n\u2022 Reduce staff training time through intuitive workflows\r\n\r\nCore Features Overview\r\nCentralized Camp Operations\r\n\r\nAll camp data lives in one system, including campers, staff, sessions, incidents, and parent information. Staff no longer rely on spreadsheets, paper lists, or disconnected tools.\r\n\r\nNFC Wristband Integration\r\n\r\nEach camper is assigned an NFC wristband used for identification, check-in/check-out, medical access, and incident logging. Wristbands act as secure lookup keys and never store personal data.\r\n\r\nRole-Based Access Control\r\n\r\nEvery user has a clearly defined role that determines what data they can see and what actions they can perform. This ensures privacy, security, and simplicity across the platform.\r\n\r\nOffline-First Reliability\r\n\r\nCore operations such as NFC scanning, check-ins, and incident logging work without an internet connection. Data automatically syncs when connectivity is restored.\r\n\r\nParent Engagement Portal\r\n\r\nParents are given secure access to manage their child\u2019s information, medical forms, and emergency contacts without involving staff.\r\n\r\nIncident Tracking & Accountability\r\n\r\nIncidents are logged with timestamps, severity, and follow-up tracking to ensure accountability and proper communication.\r\n\r\nEmbedded AI Assistant\r\n\r\nAuthorized staff can query camp data using natural language (read-only) to quickly retrieve information without navigating menus.\r\n\r\nIntended Users\r\n\r\n\u2022 Camp leadership and administrators\r\n\u2022 On-site counselors and staff\r\n\u2022 Parents and guardians\r\n\r\nCampSync is designed to scale operational complexity while remaining simple to use in high-pressure, real-time camp environments."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You want to build CampSync, a secure, offline-capable digital platform designed to manage and streamline operations for a summer camp. It will centralize staff workflows, camper management, incident reporting, NFC wristband usage, and parent engagement into one cohesive system. Here's a plan for the initial version of the app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A welcoming screen providing an overview of key camp activities, announcements, and quick access to essential features.\n-   **Camper Management:** A section to view camper profiles, medical information, emergency contacts, and NFC wristband details. This section should support offline access for critical data.\n-   **Incident Reporting:** A module for logging incidents with timestamps, severity levels, and follow-up actions. This should also function offline and sync when connectivity is available.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F9F9F9` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#3F51B5` (Indigo)\n    *   Secondary: `#E64A19` (Deep Orange)\n    *   Accent: `#009688` (Teal)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD54F` (Amber)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create the basic folder structure:** Create the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file, and other necessary files.\n2.  **Implement the Home Screen/Dashboard:** Create a basic layout with placeholders for announcements and quick actions.\n3.  **Implement the Camper Management screen:** Create a screen to display a list of campers (dummy data for now).\n4.  **Implement the Incident Reporting screen:** Create a form for logging incidents with basic fields.\n5.  **Implement basic navigation:** Implement navigation between the Home Screen, Camper Management, and Incident Reporting screens.\n6.  **Remove the modalDemos array:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-29T21:03:16.810936"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about React Native app development, offline capabilities, and NFC integration."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for information about NFC specifically and icon names:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Let me read the current files to understand the structure:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/homeData.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/IconSymbol.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read more files to understand the complete structure:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!
